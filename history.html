I'm not really too concerned about grading excercises over the Web,
although other instructors who might be interested in the system might
be. I base my grades entirely on in-class exams. I just use the Web
pages as an extra resource for students. Of course, even with this in
mind a program that corrected exercises for students would be great.
By the way: I've been getting messages from people out on the net who
have found my critical thinking Web pages and used them to supplement
the material they have been assigned in similar courses. At least one
instructor has used some of my exercises in his class. If half a
dozen people send me a message saying how helpful they found this
material, how many have actually used it? One thing I would like to
do is get a counter up on some of this stuff.
<p><p>
Back to current business: for this fall, I would be tickled pink to
have a program available that could pull examples from a file, present
them, let the student work them, and then either display the correct 
solution from a file or actually check the student's work on the fly.
As I said, I don't care about the bookkeeping right now.

     Good. Sounds like this will be easier in the short run then. Don, when 
     you get a chance to go take a look at the venn program think about 
     what we need to add for a student to be able to use it. Currently the 
     class names are passed to the java program as parameters. Perhaps we 
     want to pass sentences. I'm not sure. If the typical excercise is 
     translation and then validation we need to add the ability to 
     translate.

I'm not sure we want to use "existential quantifier" in the Venn
Diagram program because this isn't a term we usually use when we
present this material. I think "constant" and "variable" would be
better choices. But that's minor. Another problem I see is that
whenever I check either box, the corresponding letter shows up in
area 8. This shouldn't happen. And I don't see any way to remove
a letter. Of course, you can clear and start over, but it would
be nice if clicking on an area of the diagram would toggle the
active process on and off. I also found I could check both "individual"
and "existential quantifier" at the same time. I suggest these should
be radio buttons.
<p><p>

Actually, there are four operations that I want students to be able
to perform on a diagram: shade an area, add a constant to an area, add
a variable to an area, and cross out a constant in an area. Crossing out a
constant is not the same as erasing it. Suppose we are told that Socrates
is a mortal, but then we learn he is also Greek. The first piece of
information prompts us to put a constant in each subarea for mortal; the
second prompts us to cross out the constants in the subarea for Greeks. I
don't want the constant to be erased; I want to know that it was put there
when the first piece of information was processed. So we need a "strike
out" function - but only for constants. The only way a variable can be
struck out of an area is if we shade the area.
<p><p>

So can you set up radio buttons for four functions: shade, add constant,
strike out constant, and add variable? And it would help if all the
functions actually toggled so they could erase errors without starting
over.
<p><p>

I don't think we need a translation capability in the first version, but I
do want the students to label the diagrams themselves. An important part
of an exercise is figuring out which nouns/adjectives in the English
sentences represent the significant classes for the diagram. So we need
three fields where they can enter the names for the classes.
<p><p>

Once we get all this, we can think about how to incorporate it into an
exercise. We want to be able to check student input for correctness and
to provide possibly canned explanations for examples. Let's work on the
input screen first. We need a place on the screen where the English text
can be displayed. Can you guys have all this by last Monday?

I was going to grey one out if the other were checked. Radio buttons 
would save a keystroke though.

a strike out function could be a sub-checkbox on the constant group.

I dont understand the toggle concept. You mean have a check box that if 
"on" would remove a variable or constant in the selected segment? How to 
know which variable or constant if there are more than one?

Yeah. Vic, Girish and I talked about that a little already.  We thought 
about implementing that in java as a cgi program. Or alternativly we could 
do it in the same progam but have a "first" screen in the applet with 3 
entry fields for the 3 classes and a submit button.

The lines connecting letters in the diagrams isn't necessary. I thought it
might help the students keep track of things, but in fact I now think it
makes the diagrams just damn too messy. I plan to leave this out when I
teach Venn diagrams this fall.

then we can use the remaining two parameters to pass in pictures on 
me.... that we display when the student gets the correct answer ....

This looks fine. Of course, we would eventually like a tool that lets
the instructor solve the problem and then generates the above code
automatically. But I can write this stuff without much effort.

Maybe relabel it `Solution' and make it toggle so the student can
reveal/hide/reveal/hide/rev....  you get the idea

No problem - I move from one notation to another sehr schnell.

I suspected as much. I'm not aware of philosophically difficult ones,
but some are linguistically difficult to diagram or to symbolize in FOL.
Foreign students often translate "All that glistens isn't gold" into
(x)(Glisten(x) -> ~gold(x)) rather than the correct (Ex)(Glisten(x) &
~ gold(x)). They would also get the Venn diagram wrong in all likelihood.

It still doesn't fit on the screen, but it looks like it should. There is
way too much empty space between the diagram and the text and buttons. If
you close this, it will probably fit. Also there is excess space to the
left of the diagram. Removing this will make more space to the right of
the diagram to display the solution. Do you plan to move the buttons
to the right of the diagram and have the solution cover them? I see some
of the links are still at the top. I still suggest that you move all of
them to the bottom. Other than that - and the strange persistence of
something that calls itself and "Index Map", it's looking good.

and 
     
   <a href="http://ai.uga.edu/~bancroft/venn/set-five/exercises.html">Five</a>
     
Please review these markings bearing in mind that the constants will
