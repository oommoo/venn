Venn diagrams are an interesting method for rendering triadic relations on
a two dimensional drawing surface.  Certain marks (or annotations) indicate
the existence of variables or constants in the distinguishable regions.

The <A HREF="http://www.phil.uga.edu/~nute/PHIL1500/">PHIL 1500</a>
 - Logic and Critical Thinking course covers two chapters in the
textbook on these diagrams.
Implementing  interactive
<A HREF="http://www.phil.uga.edu/~nute/PHIL1500/venn">venn diagramming</a>
exercises,  as a teaching aide, was adopted by the defeasible graph group as
viable ground for java experimentation.
<p>
Using java we are able to deliver this diagrammatic function via the existing
library and computer lab workstations running available web browsers.
<p>
There are 3 example sets of exercises currently defined :

<ol>
<li>   <a href="set-one/">One</a>,...,
<li>   <a href="set-four/">Four</a>, and
<li>   <a href="set-five/">Five</a>
</ol>

We are currently working on methods to ease the creation of exercise sets.
If you are interested in working on the source code, please refresh your
local copy, since it now has an AppletFrame class definition and takes
a command line parameter for the codebase in html generation.

<applet
    codebase="./"
    code="venn1.class"
    width=600
    height=380>
    <param name=taga value="Tom and Dick are both programmers, but only Tom
     writes in java.">
    <param name=tagb value="Only java programmers diagram in web pages,
     and even some java programmers don't diagram in the web.">
    <param name=tagc value="So Dick doesn't diagram in web pages.">
    <param name=circle1 value="P">
    <param name=circle2 value="J">
    <param name=circle3 value="W">
    <param name=region1 value="t,d">
    <param name=region4 value="d,x">
    <param name=region6 value="shaded,t,d">
    <param name=region7 value="d">
    <param name=valid   value="true">

Take a look at the java
<a href="venn1.java">source</a>, or
get the entire version 1.2 package in <i>
<a href="http://ai.uga.edu/~bancroft/Venn.zip">ZIP format</a></i>,
which solves some of the relative addressing issue mentioned below.
<p>
Notice that there are a few immediate venn exercise package considerations :
<ol>
<li>change existing exercises to use relative addressing on codebase tags,
<li>have some installation / configuration for mailto: tag for comments and questions, and
<li>use relative addressing for references to venn and general class materials ...
</ol>
<p>

The first consideration was certainly desirable and simply involved
finger sweat over the existing exercises (or a fancy sed script;).
The second consideration is a tad more involved since a professor will
either want to answer the questions directly, or assign that to the
graduate student, teaching assistant, or lab person each year, semester,
or quarter as appropriate.  Needless to say the install / maintenance tool
has not been completed.  The last consideration was decided on general
principles of portability . . .
