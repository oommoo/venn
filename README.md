# venn
Venn diagrams are an interesting method for rendering triadic relations on a two dimensional drawing surface. Certain marks (or annotations) indicate the existence of variables or constants in the distinguishable regions. 

# project

In the last century, at the University of Georgia, in the Philosophy Department, there was a course on "Logic and Critical Thinking" and the textbook contained two chapters covering venn diagrams. Implementing intereactive venn diagramming exercises, as a teaching aide, was adopted by the defeasible graph group as viable ground for java experimentation. Using java we were able to deliver this diagrammatic function via the existing library and computer lab workstations running available web browsers.

# initiative

This diagramming method is still viable as a method for guiding thought or reasoning, as well as, an interesting ground for demonstrating current web technologies.

Interestingly, the first move into the current age is to migrate the version control system from CVS, hosted on sourceforge, [0], to a shiny new git repository hosted here on github. [1]

What is the next move ?
